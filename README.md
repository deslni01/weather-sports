# The Odin Project 2

## Project: Weather App

[Live Page Here](https://deslni01.github.io/weather-sports/)

### Comments:

### Remaining Tasks:

-   [x] Add search bar and JS to change location of weather
-   [ ] Add NHL and MLB APIs for the sports sections

### Assignment:

-   [x] Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to your JavaScript and CSS files.

-   [x] Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the information.

-   [x] Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.

-   [x] Set up a simple form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).

-   [x] Display the information on your webpage!

-   [x] Add any styling you like!

-   [ ] Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API.

-   [x] Push that baby to github and share your solution below!
